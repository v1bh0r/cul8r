  Saw an exciting new movie!<br/>
  Thought I just have to watch it.<br/>
  I'm a busy guy,<br/>
  Days went by and I forgot all about it.<br/>
  I wish someone had told me when it was showing in the theaters<br/>
  or when it came out on DVD.<br/>
  Then cul8r was born and I shouted loud with glee!<br/>
